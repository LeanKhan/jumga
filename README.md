# Jumga Stores

Jumga is an e-commerce platform where people can open shops online and sell their goods.
Jumga utilises [Flutterwave](https://flutterwave.com) to process payments.

## How it works

_consider this scenario..._

Bolu wants to open an online Biro shop, because why not, so she goes to [Jumga](https://jumga.stores) because that's where it's at yo.

- [picture of register]
  She clicks "Register" and follows the steps to open here shop, pays the $20 opening feee (- processing fees) then adds an account to the shop so she can begin to receive payments.

- [picture]
  As soon as she completes her setup, a dispatch rider is assigned to her shop "Bolu's Biros" to deliver her pen's to customers.

- [picture]
  On her shop dashboard she can:
- Add Products (Single add or Batch Add)
- View Sales
- Edit her shop
- Even delete her shop if she wants (but she won't. **no one does muahahaha :)**)

## For Shoppers

Bolu's friend Kauna has a biro problem and has to get new pens every weekend so she goes to her friends shop of course.

- [explore page]
  Kauna visits the Explore page to search products

- Searches for 'black pen'
- Visits the product page and buys
- O tan!

## For International Shoppers

Kauna tells her Kenyan course mate Gathii about "Bolu's Biros", Gathii is however wondering if he can pay all the way from Kenya, Gathii learns that Jumga Shops can receive payments from Kenya, Ghana and the UK! _nzuri sana_ he says.
Gathii heads over to Jumga and changes his country to Kenya. Now he can shop and pay in Kenyan Shillings!

## Split Payments

Bolu is very excited because Jumga only charges a 2.5% commission on all sales! Her Dispatch Rider Kachi is also happy about Jumga because Jumga only charges 20% commission on each delivery and his money gets settled into his account by virtue of Flutterwave. Not bad, not bad.

## Admin Dashboard

Meanwhile in the background, Emmanuel, Jumga's senior manager, is monitoring all this activity from the Admin Dashboard. There, Emmanuel can:

- Create Shop categories
- Edit Country data
- Add Dispatch Rider etc

Awesome! Everyone is happy and Bolu is now the largest retailer of pens and pencils in West Africa. Only on Jumga :)

**NOTES**
Please make sure there are enough Dispatch Riders when creating a new Shop. Only `unemployed` Dispatch Riders with `accounts` will be assigned to Shops. So after adding a Dispatch Rider on the Admin Dashboard, add their account by selecting the Rider and clicking 'add account'. Thanks!

There is a sample of Products inside this [spreadsheet].
