## Client-side Javascript

---

Any Javascript that runs in the browser is here. I would've preferred to have the js closer to the .vue but anyhow...

Vue files are the ones like `explore.vue.js` which is the Javascript part of the `Explore` pages Vue app.

Then there are normal javascript files like `shared.js` which has some functions that other scripts use.
